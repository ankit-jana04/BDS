Below are the detailed steps and commands to install, configure, and run Apache Storm on an Ubuntu machine, based on your specifications.

 Prerequisites
Ensure your system has the following software installed:

1. Java (JDK 8 or later)
2. ZooKeeper (required for Storm)
3. Python (for Storm UI)
4. wget/unzip (to download Storm)

 1. Install Java

Step 1: Update package lists and install OpenJDK

---  sudo apt update
---  sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk


Verify the installation:

---  java -version


 2. Install ZooKeeper

---  sudo apt install -y zookeeperd


Start the ZooKeeper service:

---  sudo systemctl start zookeeper
---  sudo systemctl enable zookeeper


Check the status of the ZooKeeper service:

---  sudo systemctl status zookeeper


Verify that ZooKeeper is running:

---  echo "ruok" | nc localhost 2181

You should see `imok` if ZooKeeper is running correctly.

 3. Download and Install Apache Storm
Navigate to the /opt directory and download the Apache Storm tar.gz file:

---  cd /opt
---  sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/storm/apache-storm-2.8.0/apache-storm-2.8.0.tar.gz


Verify SHA512 for download (optional, for security):

---  sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/storm/apache-storm-2.8.0/apache-storm-2.8.0.tar.gz.sha512
---  sha512sum -c apache-storm-2.8.0.tar.gz.sha512


Extract the archive:

---  sudo tar -xvzf apache-storm-2.8.0.tar.gz


Rename the directory:

---  sudo mv apache-storm-2.8.0 storm


Set permissions:

---  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/storm


 4. Configure Apache Storm
Edit the `storm.yaml` configuration file:

---  nano /opt/storm/conf/storm.yaml


Add or update the following lines:
yaml

storm.zookeeper.servers:
  - "localhost"
nimbus.seeds: ["localhost"]
supervisor.slots.ports:
  - 6700
  - 6701
  - 6702
  - 6703
ui.port: 8080

Save and exit: (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter)

Create the local directory for Storm:

---  sudo mkdir /opt/storm/tmp


 5. Start Apache Storm Services
Open multiple terminal tabs or use tmux/screen to run the following components in parallel:

---  Run Nimbus (Master node):

---  cd /opt/storm
---  bin/storm nimbus


Run Supervisor (Worker node):

---  cd /opt/storm
---  bin/storm supervisor


Run Storm UI (Web interface):

---  cd /opt/storm
---  bin/storm ui


 6. Access the Storm UI
Now, you can visit the following URL to view the Storm UI:

---  http://localhost:8080


 7. Submit a Sample Topology
Submit the sample ExclamationTopology:

---  cd /opt/storm
---  bin/storm jar examples/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-*.jar org.apache.storm.starter.ExclamationTopology exclamation-topology


 After Submission
Check logs to confirm itâ€™s running properly and look for your topology in the UI:

---  tail -f /opt/storm/logs/*

Visit the Storm UI (`http://localhost:8080`) to see the status of your submitted topology.






 Optional: Kill the Topology Later
If you want to stop it:

---  cd /opt/storm
---  bin/storm kill exclamation-topology


These steps should install, configure, and run Apache Storm on your Ubuntu system successfully.
