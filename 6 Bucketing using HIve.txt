Certainly! Below is a comprehensive guide that outlines the steps, commands, and the necessary actions to implement bucketing using Hive in Ubuntu.

 Step-by-Step Instructions for Implementing Bucketing using Hive

1. Open Terminal and Start Hive
   To access Hive, you'll need to open your terminal. If Hive is installed, you can start it by using:
   
---     sudo ./hive
   

2. Create a Database
   After entering the Hive shell, create a database named `show_bucket`:
---     
---     create database show_bucket;
   

3. Show Databases
   To confirm that the database was created:
---     
---     show databases;
   

4. Use the Created Database
   Switch to the newly created database `show_bucket`:
---     
---     use show_bucket;
   

5. Create a Table
   Now, create a table `emp_demo` with appropriate columns:
---     
---     create table emp_demo (id int, name string, salary int) 
---     row format delimited 
---     fields terminated by ',';
   

6. Show Tables
   Verify that the table has been created successfully:
---     
---     show tables;
   

7. Create the Data File
   You will need a data file named `emp_details.txt`. To create it, use:
   
---     sudo nano emp_details.txt
   
   Inside the file, add the following data:
   
   1,Harsh,95000
   2,Ramdas,85000
   3,Omkar,90000
   4,Shubham,80000
   5,Kaushal,75000
   

   Save and close the file (in Nano, you can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, followed by `Enter`).

8. Check Files
   List the files in your working directory to ensure the `emp_details.txt` is present:
   
---     ls
   

9. Load Data into Table
   Go back to the Hive shell to load the data into the `emp_demo` table:
   
---     sudo ./hive
---     use show_bucket;
---     load data local inpath 'emp_details.txt' into table emp_demo;
   

10. Verify Table Schema
    To check the schema and confirm that data has been loaded:
    
---      DESCRIBE emp_demo;
    

11. Enable Bucketing
    Set the property for bucketing:
    
---      set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
    

12. Create a Bucketed Table
    Create a new table `emp_bucket` for bucketing:
    
---      create table emp_bucket (id int, name string, salary int) 
---      clustered by (id) into 4 buckets 
---      row format delimited 
---      fields terminated by ',';
    

13. Insert Data into Bucketed Table
    Insert data from the original `emp_demo` table into the `emp_bucket`:
    
---      insert overwrite table emp_bucket select * from emp_demo;
    

14. Verify Bucketed Table Output
    Check if the data has been properly inserted and view the contents:
    
---      hdfs dfs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/show_bucket.db/emp_bucket
    

15. Drop All Tables and Database
    To clean up after your operations, drop the database and all tables:
    
---      DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS show_bucket CASCADE;
    

16. Show Remaining Databases
    Verify that the database is dropped:
    
---      show databases;
    

17. Delete All Files in HDFS
    Finally, delete any files created in HDFS during this session:
    
---      hdfs dfs -rm -r /user/hive/warehouse/show_bucket.db
    

18. Delete Local Files
    You can also clean up local files created during this session:
    
---      cd /usr/local
---      sudo rm -rf sds_a016
    

 Conclusion
Following these steps will allow you to implement bucketing using Hive effectively. Be sure to modify paths and file names according to your project-specific requirements. This guide is structured to work in a terminal on an Ubuntu system with Hive installed.
