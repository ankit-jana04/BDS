To set up a similar environment on Ubuntu for using MongoDB and Python, you'll need to follow a series of installation and configuration steps. Below is a detailed guide:

 Step 1: Install MongoDB

1. Update your package list:
   
---     sudo apt update
   

2. Install MongoDB:
   To install MongoDB, use the following commands:
   
---      sudo apt install -y mongodb
   

3. Start MongoDB:
   
---      sudo systemctl start mongodb
   

4. Enable MongoDB to start on boot:
   
---      sudo systemctl enable mongodb
   

 Step 2: Launch MongoDB

5. Open MongoDB Shell:
   
---      mongo
   

 Working with MongoDB

Now that MongoDB has been installed and launched, you can perform various operations:

- Show list of databases:
  javascript

---     show dbs
  

- Create or switch to a database:
  javascript

---     use udit
  

- Show existing collections:
  javascript

---     show collections
  

- Create a collection:
  javascript

---     db.createCollection("subjects")
  

- Insert documents into the collection:
  javascript

---     db.subjects.insertOne({"name": "bda"})
---     db.subjects.insertOne({"name": "mn"})
---     db.subjects.insertOne({"name": "ip"})
---     db.subjects.insertOne({"name": "msa"})
  

- Display all records in the collection:
  javascript

---     db.subjects.find()
  

- Display a specific record in the collection:
  javascript

---     db.subjects.find({"name": "bda"})
  

 Step 3: Using Python with MongoDB

1. Install Python and Pip:
   If you don't have Python installed, you can install it by running:
   
---      sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   

2. Install PyMongo:
   Use pip to install the PyMongo library:
   
---      python3 -m pip install pymongo
   

3. Create a Python script to interact with MongoDB:
   
   Open a new Python file, e.g., `mongodb_example.py` and add the following code:

   python

---      from pymongo import MongoClient

   # Create a client object to communicate with the running MongoDB instance

---      myclient = MongoClient(host="localhost", port=27017)

   # Check database list

---      print(myclient.list_database_names())

   # Define which database you want to use

---      db = myclient["udit"]  # Switch to the "udit" database

   # Create a collection

---      col = db["subjects1"]

   # Create a dictionary and insert into collection

---      data = {"name": "ds", "sem": "1"}
---      col.insert_one(data)

   # Print all databases names

---      print(myclient.list_database_names())
   

4. Run the Python script:
   
---      python3 mongodb_example.py
